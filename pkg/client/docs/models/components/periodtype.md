# PeriodType

How long a reconciliation period lasts. Scopes each failing fingerprint
into a period so a March break and an April break are distinct,
independently-closable cases.

Omit the key to get `continuous`, a single unbounded period (live
monitoring). There is deliberately no schema-level `default`: SDK
generators materialize defaults into the serialized body, which would
make an omitted key indistinguishable from an explicit one and collide
with the deprecated `cadence` alias. The server owns the default.

This is not how often the rule runs — that is `schedule`, and the two are
independent: an hourly schedule with a `monthly` period type is normal.
The period type determines the `periodID` an alert is filed under:
`monthly` yields `2026-07`.


## Example Usage

```go
import (
	"github.com/formancehq/reconciliation/pkg/client/models/components"
)

value := components.PeriodTypeContinuous

// Open enum: custom values can be created with a direct type cast
custom := components.PeriodType("custom_value")
```
